                    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While large volumes of water can be found throughout
                     the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land,
                      consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.
                       Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds.
                    Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received
                    by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean
                     circulation. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. Greenhouse gases in
                     the atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. A region's climate is
                      governed by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones,
                       thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.
                    Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive.
                     Earth is about eight light minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution.
                     Earth rotates around its own axis in just less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes).
                     Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons.
                     Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 380,000 km (1.3 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth.
                     The Moon always faces the Earth with the same side through tidal locking and causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
                    Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it.
                    Life spread globally and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to Earth's Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached a population of almost 8 billion today.
                     Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted Earth's environment. Today, humanity's impact on Earth's climate, soils, waters,
                      and ecosystems is unsustainable, threatening people's lives and causing widespread extinction of other life.

            <p class="para1">In its most general sense, the term "world" refers
                 to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to
                 everything that is.[1] The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently
                 in different fields. Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a
                 "plurality of worlds". Some treat the world as one simple object while others
                 analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts. In scientific cosmology the world or universe is
                 commonly defined as "[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be". Theories of modality,
                 on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been. Phenomenology,
                 starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon
                 or the "horizon of all horizons". In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind.
                  Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation,
                   as identical to God or as the two being interdependent.
                   In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material
                    or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice.
                   A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview.
                   Cosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation of the world while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things
                    or of the end of the world...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World">take me to wikipedia website</a></p>
